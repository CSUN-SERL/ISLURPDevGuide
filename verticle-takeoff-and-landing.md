## FireFly6 Summary

The FireFly6 is the primary Vertical Takeoff and Landing \(VTOL\) aircraft implemented into the ISLURP program. By rotating it's forward props, it is capable of transitioning between a fixed wing aircraft and tricopter. The ability to transition between these two modes allows the FireFly6 to be one of the most dynamic drones in the system. The versatility of the FireFly6 enables the drone to easily survey large areas from any location by combining its ability to takeoff without the need for a runway and switch into a fixed wing aircraft to travel farther distances. So far, the primary role of the FireFly6 is to survey target areas from high altitudes to give a third person view of a situation.
