## Summary
It is very important to install all the required dependencies before running any of the code presented in this repository. The required dependencies have been organized by their respective section of the project. As a start, we recommend installing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit.

The following shell script automates most of the process for setting up the development environment for the project. If your Linux installation is free of ROS and OpenCV, you can just run the script to install all the dependencies. 

In short, the following script will download and install `ros-indigo-desktop`, `opencv-3.0` and its' dependencies, and `libuvc` from source and its' dependencies. All downloaded files are located in `~/lcar-bot-files`. The only thing left to do at that point is to navigate to `~/lcar-bot-files`, clone the lcar-bot repository, and run catkin_make inside the `lcar-bot` folder. 
To get started, open a text editor of choice, copy the script into it and save it as `install-lcar-bot.sh` to your home directory and close. Then open a new terminal and type `chmod +x install-lcar-bot.sh`. Lastly, type `./install-lcar-bot.sh` and hit enter. Sit back and relax, the script will take some time to finish.

_Note: If you have already installed `ros-indigo-desktop-full` instead of `ros-indigo-desktop`, it is best to completely uninstall ROS and reinstall the correct version of ROS. Same goes for OpenCV. If you have version 2.4 of OpenCV installed, it's best to remove that as well. To purge your system of ROS and OpenCV before running the script, run `sudo apt-get purge ros-*`, `sudo apt-get purge libopencv`, and `sudo apt-get autoremove` in the terminal, respectively._

```

Lastly, we need to modify the udev rules. Add the following code to a new file called `LI_Stereo.rules` and save it in the `/etc/udev/rules.d` directory:

```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{manufacturer}=="Leopard Imaging", ATTRS{product}=="LI-STEREO", GROUP:="video"
```


The following is a list of updated packages to ensure that:
     1. Your installation does not have any OpenCV-2.4 dependencies
     2. Your installation will work with OpenCV-3.0
        (At the time of this writing stereo_image_proc needed to be manually updated to work with OpenCV-3.0)

```
