## Husky Summary

The Husky unmanned ground vehicle \(UGV\) is the only ground vehicle incorporated into the ISLURP system and serves as a support vehicle for drones. Firstly, it extends the range of the UAVs by acting as a signal medium to boost control signals and prevent drones from disconnecting, whether by flying to far out of range or operating in a low signal environment. Secondly it serves as a landing platform for smaller drones, such as the quadrotors, to land, recharge their batteries, and stay in the field for a longer period of time without the need for human intervention.
