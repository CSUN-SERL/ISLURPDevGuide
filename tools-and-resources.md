## Tools and Resources

The ISLURP platform relies on one major framework to operate: [The Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org), more often known as ROS. In short, ROS provides a set of libraries and tools to develop for and interface with robots. Since every agent in the ISLURP systems runs on ROS, it is very important to get familiar with how it works. Below is a list of some resources to get started learning about ROS.
